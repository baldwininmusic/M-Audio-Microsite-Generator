      <h4 class="bx5-overview-header">Monitor Performance Starts with Driver Excellence</h4>
      <p>A monitor’s  drivers are the heart and soul  of its performance. Driving the low-end and midrange, BX5-D3’s 5-inch military-grade  Kevlar®  woofers are rigid  and lightweight, delivering outstanding  transient response whist negating unwanted “cone breakup.” BX5- D3’s treated silk dome tweeter provides  the perfect combination  of low mass and the absence of audible  resonances that plague conventional  tweeters. Together, the BX drivers  deliver  critical  detail,  nuance and dynamic  accuracy, so your mixes have the veracity and transparency you demand.</p>

      <h4 class="bx5-overview-header">More Than Just an Enclosure</h4>
      <p>With M-Audio’s BX5-D3, every detail has been meticulously engineered with one goal in mind - to facilitate the freedom to mix with confidence.  BX5-D3 monitors  have a rear- mounted bass port, meticulously  engineered to the exact length and diameter. The result? Deep, defined bass response with maximum bass extension and resolution. When combined  with a smoothly-flared  port, BX5-D3 monitors  markedly  reduce the audibly-intrusive air turbulence that results when bass is played back at high sound pressure levels (SPLs). BX5-D3’s tweeter is mounted in a custom waveguide for reliably accurate dispersion that eliminates unwanted high-frequency “scatter,” whilst  ensuring  a soundstage that remains  consistently  wide and stable.  For seamless  setup and easy- location of the optimum  listening position,  the BX5-D3’s front-mounted positioning  LED shines  brightly  when you’re located in the perfect listening spot, for uncompromisingly accurate and reliable critical evaluations. Finally, BX5-D3’s iconic design on the front panel—M-Audio’s famous “keyhole” shape—is more than just an attractive look: This special “fastenerless” design ensures so there are no driver attachment screw heads to interfere with the sound coming from our drivers.</p>

      <h4 class="bx5-overview-header">High-Current, High Headroom Class A/B Bi-Amplified Power</h4>
      <p>Efficient and accurate: Driving the BX5-D3 monitors are two Class A/B internal amplifiers that power the woofer and tweeter separately  - each optimised  for the specific  frequency range it handles  and engineered to complement  the characteristics  of  its  companion driver.  A  precision-tuned  crossover guarantees each  driver  only handles  the frequencies that it produces most efficiently for a sound that is cohesive across the entire frequency spectrum. Play louder with less audible distortion: The BX5-D3 bi-amplified design is a far more efficient and accurate way to power a loudspeaker than using a single full-range amplifier to drive multiple driver elements.</p>

      <h4 class="bx5-overview-header">Tailor-Made Sound</h4>
      <p>At M-Audio, we understand no two listening spaces are the same. Therefore, the BX5- D3 monitors custom tailors your sound to your environment, so you will always experience sonically-true, reassuringly-accurate sound reproduction. Negate problematic bass frequencies and limit the impact of nuisance standing waves thanks to BX5-D3’s special Acoustic Space control for precise adjustment of BX5-D3’s sound output in line with your studio space.</p>

      <h4 class="bx5-overview-header">Connectivity Covered</h4>
      <p>Whatever you needs, the BX5-D3 Studio  monitors  guarantee to assimilate  into your existing setup with ease. Combining conveniently-located, rear-mounted  XLR and 1/4- inch balanced  inputs, BX5-D3 connects to virtually  all  studio  equipment including mixers, interfaces, DJ gear and more.</p>

      <h4 class="bx5-overview-header">It’s Far More Than The Sum of Its Parts</h4>
      <p>M-Audio’s  BX5-D3 monitors  excel in every way, the rightful  successor to the original  studio  icon. Fusing  superb drivers,  meticulously  engineered enclosures, great-sounding  amplifiers,  versatile  control options  and standardized connection facilities, BX5-D3 delivers sound quality you can trust.</p>
